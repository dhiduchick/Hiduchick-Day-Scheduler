# Hiduchick-Day-Scheduler
Hiduchick UNH Bootcamp Challenge 5

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create a work day scheduler where users can add task to time slots throughout the day to keep them more organized. Once the user opens the website they are borught the a scheduler that includes he current date and time at the top of the screen as well as time slots for the hours of a 'normal' work day (9am-5pm) they are able to add task to each time slot and press a save button which not only allws the task to remain after the page is refreshed but the text is also saved into the local storage. The scheduler is also color coded meanign that times that are in the past are a grey color, the present hour is red, and future time slots are green.
